# First angular project

##### Misson:

Make an Angular application on which your friends can fill in their data so you can have it in your node.js friendlist api
using the **angular cli**.
    
### Learning objectives:

- Use the angular cli commands
- Have a basic understanding of typescript
- Generate components and services in angular
- Configure a provided node API
- Make a basic angular form
- Send http requests from an angular app to a node server


### Accomplishments

- working form (it pushes to the node server => also created working function in server.js)
- "list" is also working, but there are some changes appearance-wise in order
- must-have features covered
- routing is also available (through a nav-bar)

### Todo

- missing homepage
- finishing up with deleting by email


# Getting started:

1. install _node_modules_ with `npm install` in both subfolder ~/basic-angular-form/basic-angular-form and  ~/basic-angular-form/server
2.    * Then use the `ng serve` command in the _~/basic-angular-form/basic-angular-form_ folder(the actual **angular project**)
      * and use the `node server` command in the _~/basic-angular-form/server_ folder (the **server**)
      
3. Finally go to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) unless this port is taken (if so follow the instructions of the terminal)

ps.: the homepage is empty at the moment, so you have to start by clicking a link in the nav. Enjoy.
